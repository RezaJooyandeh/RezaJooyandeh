### Hi there 👋

It is a beautiful day to write code.

I am Reza, Group Engineering Manager at [Microsoft Vancouver](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftVan) 🍁 where I lead the team that crafts 👨🏻‍🎨 the experience of developers 👩‍💻👨🏼‍💻👩🏽‍💻 using  APIs and SDK using Azure Communication Services.

People who are close to me know that I write code for things that maybe I should not. I tend to do it because code usually works better than me, like online dating 😋.

I am super passionate about C# and particularly writing C# code that reads as natural language #code-with-no-comments.

The open source projects that I'm currently focusing on are:
* [Azure REST APIs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)
* [Azure .NET SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net)
* [Azure Python SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)
* [Azure iOS SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios)
* [Azure Java SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java)
* [Azure JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js)
* [Azure Android SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-android)
